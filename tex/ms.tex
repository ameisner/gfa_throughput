\section{GFA Throughput Prediction}

% mention the factors that play in here

\section{GFA Gain}

% reference my desi-commiss e-mail and wiki page about this
% reference DocDB entries for acceptance reports
% table for assumed gains?
% also David K's DocDB entry that includes his gain measurements

% say that in the end we just adopt the acceptance report gains since our measurements post-installation are effectively the same at the ~1% level

\section{Input GFA On-sky Data}

% justification for why this is a good data set to use
%     very close to airmass = 1
%     30-60 second exposure times

\section{Source Catalogs}

\section{PSF-based aperture correction}

% maybe show an example image?

\section{Pan-STARRS Comparison}

\section{Zeropoint Values Obtained}

% first appendix
% confirming GFA exptime with star trails

% second appendix all of the per-camera per-amp scatter plots of GFA sources
